				<b>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</b>, OM, KBE, FRS, FREng, FRSA, DFBCS, RDI (born 8 June 1955), also
				known as
				TimBL,
				is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup
				language,
				the
				URL
				system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and a professor
				emeritus
				at
				the
				Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
			</p>
			<p>

				Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first
				successful
				communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in
				mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and helped foster
				the Web's subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and director of the World Wide Web
				Consortium
				(W3C),
				which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide
				Web
				Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

			<p>Berners-Lee is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and
				Artificial
				Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[14] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[15]
				and
				a
				member
				of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member
				of
				the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute
				and
				is
				currently an advisor at social network MeWe. In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for
				his
				pioneering work. He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web
				browser,
				and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale". He was named in Time magazine's
				list of
				the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his
				invention.

			<h2 id="early"><span>Early life and education</span></h2>
			<p>Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England, the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods
				and
				Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is a professor of ecology and climate change management. His
				parents
				were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He
				attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from
				1969
				to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975. A keen
				trainspotter as a child, he learned about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He studied at
				The
				Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in
				physics. While at university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought
				from
				a repair shop.</p>
			<h2 id="Career">Career and research</h2>
			<p>After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole,
				Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software
				for
				printers.</p>

			<p>Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he
				proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information
				among
				researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.</p>

			<p>After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in
				Bournemouth,
				Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a "real-time
				remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as
				a
				fellow.</p>

			<p>In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join
				hypertext
				with the Internet:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World
					Wide
					Web."
					<footer>— Tim Berners-Lee</footer></p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very
					difficult
					when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext,
					like
					the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them
					together. It
					was a step of generalizing, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the
					documentation
					systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system."<br>
					<footer>— Tim Berners-Lee</footer></p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his
				manager, Mike Sendall, who called his proposals "vague, but exciting." Robert Cailliau had independently
				proposed a project to develop a hypertext system at CERN and joined Berners-Lee as a partner in his
				efforts
				to get the web off the ground. They used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create
				the
				World Wide Web, for which Berners-Lee designed and built the first web browser. His software also
				functioned
				as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server,
				CERN
				HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).</p>

			<p>Berners-Lee published the first website, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was
				available on the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide
				Web
				was, how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with their
				own
				website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted a public invitation for collaboration with the
				WorldWideWeb project on Usenet.</p>

			<p>In a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of eminent scientists,
				academics,
				writers, and world leaders, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked number one, with the entry
				stating, "The fastest-growing communications medium of all time, the Internet has changed the shape of
				modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world."</p>

			<p>In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various
				companies willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee
				made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium
				decided
				that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology for easy adoption.</p>

			<p>Berners-Lee participated in Curl Corp's attempt to develop and promote the Curl programming language.</p>

			<p>In 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in
				Colehill
				in Wimborne, East Dorset. In December 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the School of
				Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.</p>

			<p>In an article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes ("//") in a web
				address
				were "unnecessary." He told the newspaper that he could have easily designed web addresses without the
				slashes. "There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time," he said in his lighthearted apology.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Personallife">Personal life</h2>
			<p>Berners-Lee has said "I like to keep work and personal life separate."</p>

			<p>Berners-Lee married Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer, in 1990. She was also working in
				Switzerland at the World Health Organization. They had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, he
				married Rosemary Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London. Leith is a Canadian Internet
				and
				banking entrepreneur and a founding director of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation. The couple also
				collaborate on venture capital to support artificial intelligence companies.</p>

			<p>Berners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but he turned away from religion in his youth. After he became a
				parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist. When asked whether he believes in God, he stated: "Not in
				the
				sense of most people, I'm atheist and Unitarian Universalist."</p>

			<p>The web's source code was auctioned by Sotheby's in London during 23–30 June 2021, as a non-fungible
				token
				(NFT) by TimBL. Selling for USD $5,434,500, it was reported the proceeds would be used to fund
				initiatives
				by TimBL and Leith.</p>
