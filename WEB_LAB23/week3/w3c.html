				The
				<b>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</b>
				is the main international standards organization
				for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and led by
				<a href="tim_lee.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a>
				, the consortium is made up of member organizations
				that maintain full-time staff working together in the
				development of standards for the World Wide Web.
				As of 5 March 2023, W3C had 462 members.
				W3C also engages in education and outreach,
				develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion
				about the Web.
			</p>
			<h2 id="history">History</h2>
			<p>
				The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European
				Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute
				of
				Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European Commission, and the
				Defense
				Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the
				Internet.
				It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with the MIT Computer Science and
				Artificial
				Intelligence Laboratory, to the Stata Center.

				The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of
				new
				standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing
				inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement
				a
				set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.

				It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on
				particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in
				Computer
				Science and Automation became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC
				becoming the Asian host in September 1996. Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the
				world.
				As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Belgium,
				Netherlands and Luxembourg), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary,
				India,
				Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom
				and
				Ireland.

				In October 2012, W3C convened a community of major web players and publishers to establish a MediaWiki
				wiki
				that seeks to document open web standards called the WebPlatform and WebPlatform Docs.

				In January 2013, Beihang University became the Chinese host.

				In 2022 the W3C WebFonts Working Group won an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts
				and
				Sciences for standardizing font technology for custom downloadable fonts and typography for web and TV
				devices.

				On 1 January 2023, it reformed as a public-interest 501(c)(3) non-profit organization

			<h2 id="Specification">Specification maturation</h2>
			<p>W3C develops technical specifications for HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and other
				technologies. Sometimes, when a specification becomes too large, it is split into independent modules
				that
				can mature at their own pace. Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and
				are
				denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on each level are
				denoted by an integer following a decimal point (for example, CSS2.1 = Revision 1).

				The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity
				levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.

			<h2 id="Membership">Membership</h2>
			<p>The Consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to the public. Members
				include
				businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals.

				Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement: An application for membership must
				be
				reviewed and approved by the W3C. Many guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no
				final guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally approved or denied.

				The cost of membership is given on a sliding scale, depending on the character of the organization
				applying
				and the country in which it is located. Countries are categorized by the World Bank's most recent
				grouping
				by gross national income per capita.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Criticism">Criticism</h2>
			<p>In 2012 and 2013, the W3C started considering adding DRM-specific Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) to
				HTML5,
				which was criticised as being against the openness, interoperability, and vendor neutrality that
				distinguished websites built using only W3C standards from those requiring proprietary plug-ins like
				Flash.
				On 18 September 2017, the W3C published the EME specification as a recommendation, leading to the
				Electronic
				Frontier Foundation's resignation from W3C. As feared by the opponents of EME, as of 2020, none of the
				widely used Content Decryption Modules used with EME is available for licensing without a per-browser
				licensing fee
